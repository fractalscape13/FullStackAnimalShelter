#### _practice building an API_

#### By: **Joseph Wangemann** April 3, 2020

## Description

_This API allows users to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE postings of dogs and cats in the animal shelter._

## Specification user stories:
* A user is able to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
* A user is able to GET reviews by country, city, or destination name. Reviews are returned in order of highest to lowest rating.
* A user is able to see the most popular travel destinations by overall rating.
* A user is able to PUT and DELETE reviews.
* A user is able to receive a JSON web token (expires 1 day after issuance) by sending a valid username and password in a POST request to '/users/authenticate'. Web tokens are not currently used to authenticate user requests to GET/POST/PUT/DELETE reviews.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

### Install .NET Core

#### on macOS:
* _[Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) to download a .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp._
* _Open the file (this will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.)_

#### on Windows:
* _[Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) to download the 64-bit .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp._
* _Open the .exe file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS._

#### Install dotnet script
_Enter the command ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`` in Terminal (macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)._

### Install MySQL

#### on macOS:
_Download the MySQL Community Server DMG File [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914). Follow along with the installer until you reach the configuration page. Once you've reached Configuration, set the following options (or user default if not specified):_
* use legacy password encryption
* set password (and change the password field in appsettings.json file of this repository to match your password)
* click finish
* open Terminal and enter the command ``echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`` if using Git Bash.
* Verify MySQL installation by opening Terminal and entering the command ``mysql -uroot -p{your password here, omitted brackets}``. If you gain access to the MySQL command line, installation is complete. An error (e.g., -bash: mysql: command not found) indicates something went wrong.

#### on Windows:
_Download the MySQL Web Installer [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) and follow along with the installer. Click "Yes" if prompted to update, and accept license terms._
* Choose Custom setup type
* When prompted to Select Products and Features, choose the following: MySQL Server (Will be under MySQL Servers) and MySQL Workbench (Will be under Applications)
* Select Next, then Execute. Wait for download and installation (can take a few minutes)
* Advance through Configuration as follows:
  - High Availability set to Standalone.
  - Defaults are OK under Type and Networking.
  - Authentication Method set to Use Legacy Authentication Method.
  - Set password to epicodus. You can use your own if you want but epicodus will be assumed in the lessons.
  - Unselect Configure MySQL Server as a Windows Service.
* Complete installation process

_Add the MySQL environment variable to the System PATH. Instructions for Windows 10:_
* Open the Control Panel and visit _System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables..._
* Select _PATH..._, click _Edit..._, then _Add_.
* Add the exact location of your MySQL installation and click _OK_. (This location is likely C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin, but may differ depending on your specific installation.)
* Verify installation by opening Windows PowerShell and entering the command ``mysql -uroot -p{your password here, omitted brackets}``. It's working correctly if you gain access to the MySQL command line. Exit MySQL by entering the command ``exit``.
